# HRPL
[Hakurei Reimu](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei) Public License,  
freedom for **Everyone**.

## Problems with MIT
In the MIT License, there is a part  
```
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files...
```  
But the some characters at [TouHou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) are incapable to use this software freely, 
since the license limits the usage of this software to a ["person"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens).  
  
So I fixed this issue. for the software freedom of the [gensokyo](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Gensokyo)!  

## So what was changed?
HRPL ([Hakurei Reimu](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei) Public License) includes your permission to use the software [freely](https://www.fsf.org/) in the [gensokyo](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Gensokyo) in the license.  
Also license terms were changed to more permissive in order to make [youkais](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Youkai) and [ Half-Phantom](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Phantom#Half-human_Half-phantom) [free to use](https://fsf.org).   

## OK, Let me check the License
You can check the entire license at [LICENSE](LICENSE)

## Great, But GitHub does not recognize this.
I really want to add this license to [GNU Compatible Licenses List](https://gnu.org/licenses/) or [OpenSource Initiative Licenses List](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)   
If you really want to bring software freedom to gensokyo, feel free to create an issue to contact me. Thank you!
