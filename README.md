# HRPL
Hakurei Reimu Public License,  
freedom for **Everyone**.

## Problems with MIT
In the MIT License, there is a part  
```
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files...
```  
But the some characters at TouHou Project are incapable to use this software freely, 
since the license limits the usage of this software to a "person".  
  
So I fixed this issue. for the software freedom of the gensokyo!  

## So what was changed?
HRPL (Hakurei Reimu Public License) includes your permission to use the software freely in the gensokyo in the license.  
Also license terms were changed to more permissive in order to make yokais and half-persons free to use.  
And in order to prevent tired License typing at every single code you write, you just need to write it once.  
(or you can do it everywhere just like you use MIT License :P)   

## OK, Let me check the License
You can check the entire license at [LICENSE](LICENSE)

## Great, But GitHub does not recognize this.
I really want to add this license to [GNU Compatible Licenses List](https://gnu.org/licenses/) or [OpenSource Initiative Licenses List](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)   
If you really want to bring software freedom to gensokyo, feel free to create an issue to contact me. Thank you!
